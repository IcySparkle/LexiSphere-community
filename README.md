# LexiSphere Community

This is the public feedback and release repository for [LexiSphere](https://github.com/IcySparkle/LexiSphere-community), the Controlled Site Translator Chrome extension.

## What Is LexiSphere?

LexiSphere is a Chrome/Edge extension for deterministic, local-first translation of third-party websites. Instead of automatic machine translation, you build your own dictionaries and apply them to specific sites with precise URL-matching rules.

Key features:
- Deterministic string-table translation (no guessing)
- URL-prefix rules with fine-grained scoping
- Multiple display modes: replace text, annotate with overlay badges, or both
- Manual Capture Now scan to collect untranslated strings for incremental dictionary building
- Optional AI Assist for translation suggestions (manual, never auto-applied)
- Local-first: all data stays on your machine

## Downloads

- **Chrome Web Store**: Coming soon
- **Releases**: See the [Releases](https://github.com/IcySparkle/LexiSphere-community/releases) page for manual install packages
